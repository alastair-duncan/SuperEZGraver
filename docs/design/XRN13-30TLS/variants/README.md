handpiece_6.5mm_v21.stl - this is a variant on the V2 handpiece that does not require a brass tube fitted.
Barrel of the handpiece has been extended 4mm to accomodate the threaded section of the solenoid (so it is no longer essential to cut off the threadedsection); internal space has been expanded slightly to allow for easier insertion.

Protruding length of the piston should be reduced to a minimum of 3.2mm - this will allow for 2.5mm extension of the collet.
