The original design by Alastair Duncan was absolutely amazing. 
However, upon printing it on my rather well tweaked printer, some of the parts were way too loose.
I thought I couldn't be the only one who had such issues, so I recreated the entire model in Fusion 360 for easy editing, scaled so all the parts fit when I printed them and decided to upload both my Fusion 360 and STEP file here so others could make easy changes without Blender as well. 

I also uploaded my versions of the STL files. 

The functionality hasn't been changed at all, just the tolerance of the threads.
